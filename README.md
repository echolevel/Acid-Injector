Acid Injector converts MIDI clips generated by <strong><a href="https://maxforlive.com/library/device/8357/sting-by-iftah-a-really-nice-acid-line-generator" target="_blank">STING</strong> by <strong>IFTAH</strong></a>
(free Max For Live device) into .seq pattern dump files so you can use Behringer's <a href="https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0E24" target="_blank">Synthtribe</a> software to send 
them to your TD-3 (Roland TB-303 clone). It also generates .syx (sysex) files so you can send a pattern to the TD-3 using any sysex librarian software or sysex-friendly DAW such as Reaper.

It's browser-based, but pure Javascript and no WebMIDI or server communication is involved - it just reads and writes bytes, turning MIDI files into .seq/.syx files on the fly.

If you want a more feature-rich and aesthetically TD-3 manager, check out the awesome <a href="https://303patterns.com/">303patterns.com</a> by AudioPump. I found it to be a bit fussy about my admittedly complex and bewildering MIDI driver(s) situation, plus I made Acid Injector before I knew about it, but you might find it suits you better!
