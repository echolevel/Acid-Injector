Converts MIDI clips generated by <strong><a href="https://maxforlive.com/library/device/8357/sting-by-iftah-a-really-nice-acid-line-generator" target="_blank">STING</strong> by <strong>IFTAH</strong></a>
(free Max For Live device) into .seq pattern dump files so you can use Behringer's <a href="https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0E24" target="_blank">Synthtribe</a> software to send 
them to your TD-3 (Roland TB-303 clone). It also generates .syx (sysex) files so you can send a pattern to the TD-3 using any sysex librarian software or sysex-friendly DAW such as Reaper.

Browser-based, but pure Javascript and no WebMIDI/etc is involved - it just turns MIDI files into .seq/.syx files.
